# GCAC
Global Cannibas Applications Corporation ERC-20 Token Implementation

## Overview
Global Cannabis Applications Corp (GCAC) is a company that has licensed our Tracelocker product (branded as Efixii).  It uses these technologies to disclose cannabis chain-of-custody events, thereby enabling patients to provide crowd-sourced cannabis efficacy data. Driven by digital and cannabis industry experts, GCAC is focused on generating revenue from SaaS licensing its technology and acquiring high quality cannabis datasets that improve patient outcomes and to become the worldâ€™s largest cannabis efficacy data provider.
The main driver of the project was to create an investment route to the public company with crypto; but also to make younger, tech-savvy consumers aware via a Uniswap pair.
